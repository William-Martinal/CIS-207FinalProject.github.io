    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Cooking is my main hobby. I usually stick to stovetop
    cooking but I also love to grill and bake. The picture on the right is some stuffed
    flatbread It being one of my favorite things to cook along with doing bbq I enjoy
    cooking since it is a great way for me to relax after a long day. And it is not
    only something that I enjoy but other people are also able to enjoy the food.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Modeling is another one of my hobbies. I mainly model
    military vehicles, such as tanks, planes, and jets. It takes a good bit of time however
    I love putting them together and seeing the progress I make with them One of the first
    models I completed is on the left is the British Comet 2 that was in service in late
    WW2. Now I have built and hand painted 25 models and am currently building the M10
    Wolverine, another British tank during WW2. </p>
